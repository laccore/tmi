						<h1>Diatoms - Overview</h1>
						<p>
							Diatoms are single-celled or colonial microalgae found in almost all freshwater and marine habitats. 
							Diatoms are characterized by having a two-part cell wall composed of biogenic opaline silica. 
							The remains of diatoms are often one of the main inorganic components seen in smear slides and can account for over 80% of dry sediment weight (more commonly 2-10%). 
							Each part of a diatom cell wall is called a valve, and the shape, ornamentation, and patterns on the diatom valve can be used to <a target="_blank" href="http://westerndiatoms.colorado.edu">identify</a> each of the over 25,000 living species.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to noting the presence or absence of diatoms in smear slides, 
							other simple qualitative and quantitative measures can be made from smear slides related to
